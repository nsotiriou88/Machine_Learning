# Welcome to the Explainable AI project in Domino

Model interpretability will be one of the seminal topics of data science over the next decade. 
The field is moving quickly. Practitioners can leverage a range of tools to provide 
explainability to their models from principles of traditional statistical modeling to the latests in deep neural 
network explainers.

This project contains starter code for a few of these approaches.

## Getting Started:

### 1. You do not have to be logged in to browse and download ![](https://try.dominodatalab.com/u/joshpoduska/xAI/raw/3610408fc692ce79f4ba44a24287667ba4463949/scratch/files.png?inline=true) from the left navigation bar.

In particular look at ***traditional_methods.ipynb***, ***SHAP_and_LIME.ipynb***, and ***rtemis.R***. My xAI presentation slides are in the same location and offer a lot of information on further research into xAI.

### 2. In order to run the code on pre-configured environments in Domino you must [log in](https://www.dominodatalab.com/try). After you log in you will need to navigate back to this project either with the URL or via the search option in the upper left.

### 3. Once logged in, fork this project using the button in the upper right of this screen. ![](https://try.dominodatalab.com/u/joshpoduska/xAI/raw/3b5159c69231ddca732a95cf1cbd069574220efe/scratch/fork.png?inline=true)

### 4. In YOUR newly forked project you can spin up a workspace by navigating to ![](https://try.dominodatalab.com/u/joshpoduska/xAI/raw/7dcf968e8377ee51ac00416afcd1b323cb1ee0d9/scratch/workspaces.png?inline=true). Select an IDE. Give the workspace run a name if you like. Click Launch.
