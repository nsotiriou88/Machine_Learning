# Machine_Learning

## Intro

This is a repo for Machince learning algorithms; Python and R.
[![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/VERSION-1.0-GREEN.svg)](https://shields.io/)

It includes a lot of commends on each individual template, so that it is easier to use it as an off-the-shelf solution, with minimal effort.

## Parts

1. **Data Prepocessing**

    Clearing datasets, create categorical variables, separate training/test sets.

2. **Regression Algorithms**

	Simple Linear, Multiple Linear, Polynomial, Support Vector, Decision Trees, Random Forest.

3. **Classification Algorithms**

	Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest.

4. **Clustering**

	K-means and Hierarchical clustering.

5. **Association Rule Learning**

	Apriori and Eclat.

6. **Reinforcement Learning**
